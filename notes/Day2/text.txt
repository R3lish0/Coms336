Vector Basics
    A vector is an n-tuple, where n is the dimensionality.
    We'll mostly be in the 3-spacem so our vectors are 3-tuples

    Three basis vecotrs in 3 space:
        i hat = <1,0,0> - x dimension
        j hat = <0,1,0> - y dimension
        k hat = <0,0,1> - z dimension

    A vector V =  <x,y,z> = xi + yj + zk
    These vectors can represent a lot of things
        directions
        positions
        colors

    A direction vector is a direction from the origin, <0,0,0>

    to add two vectors, add their componets


    to scale a vector, multiply by


    Geometrci interpretation of vecotr addition

    V + W


    geomerically, the dot product tells us about the angle between the two 
    vectors

    cos(Theta) = (v . w)/(|v| . |w|)

            |v| is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

    cos(Theta) == 0 -> v is orthogonal to w
